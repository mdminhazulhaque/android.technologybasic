Technologybasic Android Port
============================

## What?? ##
[Technologybasic] (http://www.technologybasic.com/) was started as a project to translate common English terms into easy Bangla so that people can search over them and get a good knowledge on those terms. Currently the website has more than 500 terms translated into Bangla. This application is the Android port including the terms database, so you can keep an offline term dictionary.
